            <li> Drain on a tissue paper and set aside.</li>
            <li> In the same pan heat 1.5 teaspoon of oil on medium heat 
                and add cumin seeds and let them crackle.</li>
            <li> Add the onions and cook for 2 minutes till translucent. </li>
            <li> Add the ginger-garlic paste 
                and cook for another 2 minutes or till the raw smell goes away. </li>
            <li> Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes till they are little soft. </li>
            <li> Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder and amchur (mango powder). </li>
            <li> Cover the pan and let the masala cook for 2-3 minutes and then add the potatoes and cauliflower to it and mix. </li>

                and cook more additional 6-7 minutes 
                on low flame or till the potato and cauliflower are tender but not soggy. 
                If you feel the masala is sticking, you may add some water.  
                Add 1 tablespoon at a time and only add enough to cook the veggies.
