        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> Truly fluffy, chewy, bubbly naan. </p>
        <p> Nobody will ever mistake this for just another basic flatbread! 
            Perfect for slopping up your favourite Indian curries, 
            yet so good that you'll happily devour it plain, straight out of the skillet.</p>
        
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 tsp instant / rapid rise yeast</li>

            <li> 1 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li> 2 tbsp milk <em> full fat, low fat ok too</em></li>
            <li> 1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg <em> at room temp </em></li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp salt <em> cooking / kosher </em></li>
            <li> 1 3/4 cups bread flour <em> or all-purpose/plain </em></li>
            <li> 30g / 2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter <em> melted </em></li>
            <li> 30g / 2 tbsp tbsp ghee or butter <em> melted </em></li>
            <li> Nigella seeds </li>
            <li> Coriander/cilantro </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> <strong>Bloom yeast:</strong> Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. 
                Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li> <strong>Egg and milk:</strong> Whisk milk and egg together.</li>
            <li> <strong>Flour:</strong> Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl. </li>
            <li> <strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, 
                and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. 
                Once the flour is mostly incorporated, 
                switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required.</li>
            <li> <strong>Proof 1:</strong> Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1/1.5 hrs until it doubles in size. </li>
            <li> <strong>Cut into 6 pieces:</strong> Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. 
                Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres 
                with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under.</li>
            <li> <strong>Proof 2:</strong> Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, 
                cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. 
                Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%.</li>
            <li> <strong>Roll out:</strong> Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 - 4mm / 0.12 - 0.16" thick rounds
                 (about 16cm / 6.5" wide).</li>
            <li> <strong>Heat skillet:</strong> Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). 
                Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cook naan:</strong> Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes 
                until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred - the surface should get bubbly. 
                Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cook remaining naan:</strong> Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, 
                taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot.</li>
            <li> <strong> Finishing:</strong> Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee. Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
