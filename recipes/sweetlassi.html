        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> Lassi is a cooling, refreshing, probiotic drink perfect for the warm summer months. 
            Popular in Punjab and North India, there are many variations of this sweet lassi recipe.
        </p>

        <p> Relished in hot summers because of its cooling properties, 
            we often make lassi using a wooden churner and blender 
            (called as madani, in Punjabi and Hindi language). 
            You can choose to blend the lassi ingredients in a blender or 
            with a wired whisk or immersion blender.
        </p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups Curd <em> cold and fresh yogurt </em></li>
            <li> 1 cup water or milk <em> cold or at room temperature </em></li>
            <li> 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar or add as per taste </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon cardamom powder or 8 to 10 green cardamoms or 1 tablespoon rose water </li>
            <li> 10 to 12 saffron strands </li>
            <li> 6 to 8 ice cubes </li>
            <li> 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped nuts <em> cashews/almonds/pistachios </em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> In a mortar, take the green cardamom pods and crush them lightly. 
                Remove the husks and crush the seeds to a fine powder.</li> 
            <li> In a bowl or pan, take fresh chilled curd (yogurt).</li>
            <li> With the handheld wooden churner (madani)or blender or wired whisk, 
                simply whisk the curd until it becomes smooth.</li>
            <li> Add sugar and cold water. You can also add cold milk instead of water.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this lassi is neither thick nor thin. For a thin lassi, 
                add slightly more water and for a thicker version, add less water.</li>
            <li> Now churn or beat again with the churner, blender or wired whisk.</li>
            <li> Keep on churning or whisking until the sugar dissolves and you see a nice frothy layer on top. 
                You can use an immersion blender for the same. 
                Another way is to add all the ingredients in a blender jar 
                and blend until smooth and frothy.</li>
            <li> Now add the crushed cardamom powder and saffron strands. Mix well. Do check the taste and add more sugar if required.</li>
            <li> As a substitute for cardamom powder, add rose water. You can skip all the flavoring ingredients, if you don't have any.</li>
            <li> Pour lassi in tall glasses and serve. Add a few ice cubes if you prefer. 
                If you want, you can top lassi in each glass with 1 to 2 tablespoons of malai 
                (the thick layer of cream which collects on top of heated milk) 
                or 1 to 2 tablespoons of unsalted white butter (makhan).</li>
            <li> Garnish with a pinch or two of cardamom powder, 
                2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts like cashews, pistachios or almonds. 
                Serve sweet punjabi lassi straightaway.</li>
        </ol>
