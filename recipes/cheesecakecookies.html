        <h4> Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/2 cup unsalted butter <em> 113g, room temperature </em></li>
            <li> 4 ounces cream cheese <em> 113g, room temperature </em></li>
            <li> 1 cup granulated sugar <em> 200g </em></li>
            <li> 1 egg <em> room temperature </em></li>
            <li> 2 tsp vanilla extract <em> 10 ml </em></li>
            <li> 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour <em> 210 g </em></li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp baking powder </li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp salt </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4> Steps </h4>    
        <ol>
            <li> Whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li> Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, 
                or an electric hand mixer, 
                cream the butter and cream cheese together. 
                Add the sugar in and beat until light and fluffy. 
                Add the egg and vanilla in and mix until combined. 
                Scrape the bowl down and mix one more time to combine.</li>
            <li> Add the dry mixture into the wet and mix on low until just combined. 
                Use a spatula to scrape the bottom and give the mixture one last mix then cover and 
                chill for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Heat oven to 375F then portion out roughly two tablespoon-sized pieces and roll into a ball. 
                The dough will be sticky so It's best to dampen your hands a bit and 
                just wash them when they get a bit covered. 
                Place about two inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silpat 
                and bake for 10 minutes or until the edges are set and just turning golden.</li>
        </ol>
